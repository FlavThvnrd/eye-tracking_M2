This is a repository for sharing our eye-tracking project realised during our second year of master degree (2 month duration).

We are focusing on analysing gaze data to get heatmap of gaze from different users in order to make some interpretability on different machine learning algorithm to retrieve sensometric conclusions obtained during sensorial analysis.
